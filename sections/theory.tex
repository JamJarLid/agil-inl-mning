\section{Theory}
  \subsection{Continuous Delivery}
    Within DevOps, the terms CI/CD are used frequently when discussing the development process. CI stands for Continuous Integration, a practise to merge changes in the codebase back to the main branch as often as possible, in order to reduce information assymetry between developers and avoid integration challenges that can arise when multiple people work on the same feature. The way that continuous integration often is introduced is through pipelines containing automated tests triggered upon push or merge, that check the incoming changes for potential breaks before the code is merged into the main branch.\ref{Atlassian}

    The term CD can have two different meanings, namely Continuous Delivery or Continuous Deployment.
