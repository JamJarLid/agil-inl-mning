\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Background}
    During my internship I worked at a company that followed SCRUM as their software development methodology. The development process was following SCRUM almost throughout the entire cycle, but there was one aspect that seemed to escape at the end of every sprint, namely delivery. When it came time to consolidate the sprint and deliver it to the customer, there seemed to always be some sort of delay, causing the delivery portion of the previous sprint to bleed over into the following sprint. This in turn caused a developer to be unable to work on the current sprint goal for some hours during the sprint, therefore losing precious development time. Upon seeing this process happening on multiple occasions, I felt that there has to be a way to solve this systemic delay in the development cycle.

  \subsection{Purpose}
    In this article I will examine the role and importance of delivery within SCRUM as a methodology, and analyze and discuss the use of Continuous Delivery as a solution and improvement to the development cycle descibed above.
